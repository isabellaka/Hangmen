# Hangmen
## Description
**Important:** In order to be able to play Hangmen, you have to create a text file at first, which contains several words in a separate line. The path of this text file has to be passed as command line argument when executing the project.

Hangmen is a game where you can play several rounds of the well-known game Hangman. The words you have to guess are taken from the text file you passed as command line argument. Every time you make a wrong guess, the picture of the hangman is getting more detailed. When you make 11 mistakes, you lose. When you manage to guess the word with less than 11 mistakes, you win.
